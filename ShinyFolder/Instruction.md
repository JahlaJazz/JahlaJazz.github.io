# Purpose:
   
  1. This is a revisit of the dataset provided in the Practical Machine Learning Course. The excercise is the same, but here some of the parameters will serve as input items for the regression of the dataset using the random forest method.
  2. All of the input items can be found on the "Select Data" tab
  
# Following is a brief explanation of the tabs

## "Select Data" tab 
    a. define the percentage to use for creating the train and test data set
    b. select the predictors to use in the random forest model 
    c. define the number of resampling to occur for n fold cross validation
    d. select the depth of the random forest tree 

## "Predictor Selected" tab
    a. This is a validation of the predictor selected, from above, for the purpose of verification.

## "Data Analysis" tab
    This section provides the structure of the datasets used, namely
    a. The initial dataset, after adjustments for tideness
    b. The traing and testing datasets used for fitting and parameter tuning


## "Regression Summary" tab
    Located, in this tab, are the results of the fitted model. Please note, the results of this section may take a few seconds to appear
    
    The following items can be found on this tab:
    
    a. the results of the fitted model
    b. a visual representation of the relationship between the number of predictors and overall accuracy of the model
    c. relative importance of the predictors selected
    d. confusion matrix and statistics
    e. testing the model against the validation dataset


## "About" tab

    Information on the dataset used and the sources 
 
 
# Now it is time to play!
